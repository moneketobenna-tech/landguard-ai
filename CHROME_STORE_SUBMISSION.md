### 🏘️ NEW IN v8: Property Scam History & Alert System

The most powerful property fraud detection ever built:

✅ **Cross-Platform Scam Tracking** - Monitor listings across Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, Zillow, Rightmove, and 12+ platforms

### 🔍 How Property Scams Work (And How We Stop Them)

**The Problem:**
Scammers frequently reuse the same addresses, photos, and seller profiles across multiple platforms with slightly altered pricing. Buyers have no way to know if a property has been involved in previous scam attempts.

**Our Solution:**
LandGuard tracks every property listing across platforms and creates a comprehensive scam history. When you view a property, we instantly show you:
- How many times it's been listed in the last 30/60/90 days
- If it's listed by multiple sellers simultaneously
- Price changes and manipulation patterns
- Community reports and red flags
- Historical scam attempts at that address
